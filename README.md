### Config file format
Can be .yml or .yaml, global config is executed in all games, except if specific config for game overrides it.

The list of events can be found [here](https://overwolf.github.io/api/live-game-data).

global config format `global.yml`:
```yaml
events:
  event_name: # event name, needs to be the same as in api
    intensity: 50 # 0-100
    duration: 5 # seconds, decimal values with 1 decimal place are allowed
  # setting intensity to 0 will stop vibrations 
  # setting duration to 0 will make the vibration last forever (5 minutes) or until a event with 0 intensity is sent, useful for games that you need to be revived
  event_name2:
    intensity: 80
    duration: 5
```

game specific config format, the file name needs to be the same as the game id, for example Apex Legends: `21566.yml`
```yaml
mode: append # append or override, append will add the events to the global config, override will replace the global config with the game specific config
events:
  event_name: # event name, needs to be the same as in api
    intensity: 50 # 0-100
    duration: 5 # seconds, decimal values with 1 decimal place are allowed
```
